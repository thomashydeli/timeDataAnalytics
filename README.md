Time series data modeling and analysis

This is my first individually created repository for testing out interesting time series modeling and analysis techniques for solving real world and simulated time series challenges. This repository focuses on the topics of: forecasting, detection, clustering, decomposition, and many other time series modeling and analysis techniques, with a priority of performing interesting time series data analysis.
